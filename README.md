Creating a better world is my life's mission! Leveraging my expertise in Python, JavaScript, cloud deployments, data analysis, and systems analysis, I bring this philosophy to life through technical solutions that deliver meaningful, real-world value. With an objective and strategic approach, I craft robust solutions that have immediate impact and long-term scalability.

I enjoy solving problems through data-driven Python solutions. I am currently deepening my knowledge of Python's data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence libraries. These libraries have contributed greatly to my existing projects, but I believe you can never stop learning or optimizing enough! Additionally, front-end web development has grown on me considerably, as I hold great appreciation for modules that assist with creating beautiful data visualizations. I also recognize the critical role of clean UI design in ensuring a seamless user experience, and I have implemented these best practices in my own projects.

If you want to hire someone with this mindset and skill set, let’s chat!

#### 🗒️ Notes
* In November 2024, I consolidated **_ALL_** of my employer and school non-enterprise GitHub accounts into this one. Previously, this account was solely used for personal projects and some school projects.
* The majority of my repositories are private as they are proprietary projects created for previous and current employers.
* All public repositories are personal or school projects.
